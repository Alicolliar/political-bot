# Political Bot
This is a political bot that [ed588](http://www.github.com/ed588) made and I have simply added to.

## Features
- Immigration by immigration officers
- Arrest by police officers
- Knighting by Monarch or Regent
- Elections, with closed ballots and *much* chance for voter fraud, still very much a work in progress.
- Specific-to-my-server-only channel IDs
##### Still to add
- [ ] Finish off the voting functionality
- [x] Ensure arrest removes all roles
- [ ] Allow department to hire and party people to add members without having to harrass a mod.

## Requirements
- discord.py
- Python 3.7+

## Disclaimer
This bot is still a work in progress and it must be said that there is no single working version, 
I plan to rectify this, but until then, oh well.
