# Political Bot
This is a political bot that [https://github.com/ed588](ed588) made and I have simply added to.

## Features
- Immigration by immigration officers
- Arrest by police officers
- Knighting by Monarch or Regent
- Elections, with closed ballots and *much* chance for voter fraud.
- Specific-to-my-server-only channel IDs

## Requirements
- discord.py
- Python 3.7+

## Disclaimer
This bot is still a work in progress and it must be said that there is no single working version, 
I plan to rectify this, but until then, oh well.
